	    <h3>24 October, 2014 - On the beginnings of fall break and the Belgian university system</h3>
		<p>I write this while on a bus to Gothenburg, Sweden; this upcoming week is fall break for
		 me, so I decided to take advantage of that time and go visit my Swedish friends whom I haven't
		seen in years. I don't have classes Fridays, so I caught a Eurolines bus from Brussels to Copenhagen
		last night. Total travel time: almost 24 hours minus a few hours in Copenhagen for exploring, but
		the bus was cheaper than taking the train or flying (plus gave me more flexibility), so I went with it.
		Much of the traveling was overnight anyway, so I didn't mind. I mostly just slept (badly).</p>
		<p>I purposefully gave myself a few hours in Copenhagen to look around, but I also didn't plan anything
		to do there, so I mostly walked around downtown. Once I found a map it was much easier not to get
		lost, so I ended up walking to the planetarium (unfortunately they were only showing imax movies and didn't have
		any star shows) and sitting on the grass by a pond, which was nice. I also managed to find a cute (though I
		think pretty expensive -- I don't know how Danish kronor work!) coffee shop, so I was able to rest a bit there and
		fix half of my return tickets. Anyway, not much exciting happened in Copenhagen, but I did find Tivoli
		(a big amusement park that I went to the one day I had a flight layover with my dad a few years ago) again,
		so I might go there on my return trip if I have time.</p>
		<p>Onto my thoughts on the Belgian university system.</p>
		
		<h4>Linnea's thoughts on the Belgian university system</h4>
		<p>Verdict: Not a fan.</p>
		<p>Though really that probably mostly has to do with being used to the American university system. That and
		the fact that I would not be able to choose a strict study path for my life. Here in Belgium,
		students sign up for a specific track (such as psychology or linguistics or politics) and take the courses
		associated with said track. What's even more stressful though, is the fact that students are often only
		graded on their final exams. One grade. That's it. And all the finals take place during the month after
		break (so for fall term all the finals are in January, and for spring term all the finals are in June).
		As you might have guessed, many students fail the first time around, but they are able to sign up for
		a second round of finals that takes place even later. Talk about stress...</p>
		<p>My schedule this semester is abnormal for a normal Belgian student's schedule, </p>
	    <h3>13 October, 2014 - Why the updates stopped</h3>
		<p>Whoops, it's been over a month since my last post. To be fair, it's not
		entirely my fault. A week after I arrived in Brussels, my computer broke
		and I had a hell of a time getting it fixed, so I ended up being computerless for
		almost three weeks. That and I'm still working on completely settling in and
		figuring things out... So I'll write some real things soon, but for now there's this.</p>
		<p>It's definitely been very up and down, and I still don't feel like I've really
		connected with Brussels, and making friends is hard, but things haven't completely
		fallen apart, so it's fine.</p>

	    <h3>4 September, 2014 - Public Transportation</h3>
	    <p>I haven't always appreciated public transportation. Growing up, I always thought it was
	    crowded and dirty and never on time, so I avoided it as much as possible. Over the years
	    this viewpoint has changed, as I have experienced many varying public transportation
	    systems.</p>
	    
	    <p>From the Charlie Card in Boston to the Orca Card in Seattle to the Metro Card in New
	    York to the Oyster Card in London, with each new city comes an entirely different system.
	    I have to hand it to the British though, as they have put together an excellent one.</p>
	    
	    <p>I think the tube is one of the easiest transportation systems I have used, which is great
	    for a directionally-challenged person such as myself. There are so many lines that it's very
	    easy to connect from one line to another, and there are maps on each side of the line to let
	    you know which stops come next, in case you didn't know if you should take the north- or
	    south-bound train.</p>
	    
	    <p>To make things even better (as mentioned in the last post), London
	    has placed small maps here and there throughout the city letting you know where you are,
	    where and in which direction prominent locations are, and where the nearest tube stations are.
	    Better yet, they are oriented in the direction that you are facing! (Bonus!)</p>
	    
	    <p>So far, I haven't gotten lost once, thanks to how fool-proof London has made itself for tourists.
	    God save the Queen.</p>

	    <h3>30 August, 2014 - Ireland and The Adventure Begins</h3>
	    <h6>Note: I am unable to import any photos from my camera onto my computer
	    at the moment, so I'll have to add any photos later.</h6>
	    
	    <p>I'm currently sitting in the lobby of Astor Victoria Hostel in London. Pop music is
	    blaring from the speakers, but so far this is the only place where I know the wi-fi works, 
	    so I just have to deal with it for the time being. (Update: it works in the kitchen too!)</p>
	    
	    <p>I kept telling myself to write about Ireland sooner, but the past two weeks have 
	    felt more like a family vacation than an adventure (which makes sense, since I was
	    travelling with my family and so didn't have to think about plans or how to get places
	    or anything of that sort), so I'm just going to say a few of my thoughts/feelings/impressions
	    about Ireland and that will be that.</p>
	    
	    <h4>Linnea's Thoughts, Feelings, and Impressions of Ireland</h4>
	    <h6>(Subject to change when I actually think things through better. Which I may have done
	    as of September 4.)</h6>
	    
	    <p><ul>
		<li>The countryside is beautiful and makes me want to run away and become a hermit</li>
		<li>However, I'm not really a fan of the big cities (i.e. Dublin and Cork). Especially Dublin. The
		roads make no sense what with all the one-way streets and no turn signs, so whenever we
		had to drive anywhere, it took us at least three times as long as what we thought it
		should take. (E.g. I left an hour before my bus to London took off and got there 10 minutes
		before departure, when the station was really only a few kilometers away.)</li>
		<li>Irish toilets are weird and you have to hold down the handle for a really long time
		in order to get it to flush completely.</li>
		<li>I think my favorite things in Ireland were going to the smallest Aran island and seeing
		the shipwreck there, and seeing a tiny mouse while on a very picturesque hike.</li>
		<li>The food is pretty good overall (albeit too many chips), but I was definitely missing food
		diversity by the end.</li>
		<li>SO MANY CASTLES. EVERYWHERE CASTLES.</li>
		</ul>
	    </p>
	    
	    <h4>Linnea Travels to London (a.k.a. The Real Adventure Begins)</h4>
	    
	    <p>Taking the bus to London was an experience. After almost missing my bus (see above) and
	    saying a rushed goodbye to my parents, I boarded the bus only to find that there was only
	    one seat left, and still a few people who wanted to get on. Lucky for me, I was able to get
	    that seat (there was also another bus going to London, so it wasn't a big deal). Soon after I settled
	    into my seat, the bus driver announced that we were driving onto the ferry and that we should
	    return to the bus as soon as the captain made an announcement, or he was going to have to leave without
	    anyone who didn't show up. I think that ferry was the largest boat I've ever been on. It had at least 11
	    floors, including cabins, two movie theaters, an arcade, various food places, and lots of lounge
	    chairs. Also color-coded and named staircases ("Ruby Stairs," "Diamond Stairs," "Sapphire Stairs," etc).</p>
	    
	    <p>After the ferry, the bus took off again, only to stop pretty quickly at customs, which was the
	    second most ridiculous customs I've been to (the first being in Guadeloupe, but that's a different
	    story). We all paraded off the bus, grabbed all our luggage, and queued up to show our passports to
	    a few officials. The officials glanced at my passport, and didn't even do anything with the luggage,
	    which I thought was strange. Also after my passport had already been glanced at and okayed, 
	    an official rand after me, stopped me, rifled through my passport checking for visas (or something),
	    and questioned me about my trip intentions, which was strange. Finally, the bus took off for real.</p>
	    
	    <p>So far, it's been pretty easy to get around London, as there are signs pointing to important places
	    every so often, and there are maps on many street corners. The maps are even oriented in the direction
	    you're facing, which is great for a directionally-challenged person like me. I tried going to see
	    the changing of the guard since I got in so early, but unfortunately it's not happening until tomorrow,
	    so I'll just have to go then. My plans dashed, I wandered over to Hyde Park, where I sat on a bench
	    and listened to podcasts for a few hours, pretending that I wasn't starting to feel lonely and trying to
	    not feel super tired from sleep deprivation and lugging around a suitcase and backpack a bunch.</p>
	    
	    
	    
	<br>
	    <h3>17 August, 2014 - Boston Logan International Airport</h3>
	    
	    <p>The time has come. In a little under an hour I will be on a flight to Dublin,
	    Ireland, where I will begin my travels abroad. Not that that's anything new, really.
	    Only this time, I'll be on my own for the most part. </p>
	    
	    <p>I'm not really much for blogging, so we'll see how long this experiment lasts, 
	    but I thought it might be nice to keep a sort-of travel log here in case people
	    are actually interested in what's going on in my life. Who knows, maybe I'll have some
	    crazy stories to tell.</p>
	    
	    <p>Anyway, there's not much to say at the moment. I'm glad the whole visa fiasco is over
	    (more on that later), I'm worried I've forgotten everything important (but I always feel
	    like that), I'm apprehensive as to what's to come (but again, that always
	    happens), and of course, I already miss everyone. Anxieties bounce around in my mind like
	    a super ball in a trampolined room. Wow that was a terrible simile. (Note to self: stay away
	    from figurative language. It's not a good look for you.)</p>
	    
	    <p>Ok signing off now. They've started boarding.</p>
